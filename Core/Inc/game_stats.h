 * Data structure for storing game statistics

 * poison: poison status
 * high_score: high score
 * level: current level
 * num_apples_eaten: number of apples eaten
 * length_played: length of time played
 * sDate: date of game
 * player_name: player name
 * times_played: number of games played at this difficulty
 *
 * Total size of struct must be less than 32 bytes as the EEPROM page size is 32 bytes.

 * Current stuct sizes:
 * game_stats_t: 25 bytes
 * global_stats_t: 16 bytes
 *
 * If the struct size is changed, the EEPROM must be
 * reinitialized and the data will be reset to initial values.
